Bedtime
It's midterm season over at Strange & Fabulous University, and while many students are trying their hardest to prepare for their exams, some have opted for rather unconventional activities. For instance, instead of hitting the books, a fraction of students are participating in weird competitions.

Our protagonist in this story, Amy, albeit a diligent student, has also chosen the latter option, despite having an important exam scheduled for the following day. Although the event turned out to be a lot of fun, and Amy made some new friends, she ultimately had to spend the entire evening and a significant portion of the subsequent night cramming for her exam.

Now, feeling both content with her knowledge and utterly exhausted, she's ready to hit the sack. However, there's a twist to her predicament — as her phone was recently purchased, the time settings are all messed up! This task is proving to be quite a challenge for Amy's sleepy mind, and she's in need of some assistance.
